                    This Contract Monthly Claim application is intended for educational and administrative use.
                    It helps lecturers, Programme Coordinators, and Academic Managers capture and process monthly
                    contract teaching claims in a structured way.

                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">What information is captured?</h2>
                <ul class="small">
                    <li>Details about each claim, including hours worked and hourly rate.</li>
                    <li>Optional notes that provide context for the claim.</li>
                    <li>Optional supporting documents uploaded by the lecturer (for example, .pdf, .docx, .xlsx files).</li>
                    <li>System-generated information such as claim status and timestamps.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">How is this information used?</h2>
                <ul class="small">
                    <li>To allow lecturers to submit and review their own claims.</li>
                    <li>To allow Programme Coordinators and Academic Managers to verify, approve, reject, or settle claims.</li>
                    <li>To provide a transparent record of the status and history of each claim.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Files and supporting documents</h2>
                <p class="small mb-3">
                    Uploaded files are stored on the server and linked to the relevant claim so that authorised staff can
                    review the supporting evidence. Only common document formats are accepted, and uploads are limited in size
                    to protect the system.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h5 mt-4">Access to your information</h2>
                <p class="small mb-0">
                    Access to claim information should be restricted to appropriate academic and administrative staff.
                    In a production environment, additional measures such as authentication, role-based access control, and
                    secure storage would be used to protect personal and financial data.
